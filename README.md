Test for the GitHub tutorial.
I am finding learning to code a huge and exciting challenge! I am closing in on the first #100DaysOfCode, but feel certain that I need to commit to further systematic work. If I don't keep going according to the #100DaysOfCode-rules, I might commit to a certain number of weekly hours instead.
